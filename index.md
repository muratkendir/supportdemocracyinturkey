# Support Democracy in Turkey with Boycott

## What happened in Turkey at March 2025?

- Ekrem Imamoglu, seen as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's main political rival and mayor of the 16 million-population metropolis of Istanbul, has been arrested on charges of corruption and terrorism affiliations, after his diploma was questioned. 
- More than 2000 Turkish citizens, mostly young university students, were detained. 
- Some students and opponents have been detained in night raids in their homes and there are more than 300 detainees in total. 
- In response to these developments, a boycott movement was launched to support the street movement. 
- This movement is primarily targeting companies known for their close ties to the government and thus to Erdogan.
