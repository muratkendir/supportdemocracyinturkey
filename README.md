- Ekrem Imamoglu, seen as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's main political rival and mayor of the 16 million-population metropolis of Istanbul, has been arrested on charges of corruption and terrorism affiliations, after his diploma was questioned. 
- More than 2000 Turkish citizens, mostly young university students, were detained. 
- Some students and opponents have been detained in night raids in their homes and there are more than 300 people arrested in total. 
- In response to these developments, a boycott movement was launched to support the street movement. 
- This movement is primarily targeting companies known for their close ties to the government and thus to Erdogan.

You can support this movement by getting information about the companies listed below and boycotting them.
